# Probe Particle STM

This is implementation of efficient and simple model for simulation of High-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) and mainly scanning probe microscopy (STM).

There are two versions of the code - 

* currently developed Python/C++ version in PyProbe  (branch *PPSTM* ); 
  * to get quick esence of the AFM model you can also try web interface hostet here: http://nanosurf.fzu.cz/ppr/

works in python2.7, matplotlibm, cpp4.4.8, (for some parts ASE and GPAW are imporatant)
